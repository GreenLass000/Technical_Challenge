# Technical Challenge: TUBUNTU technologies

## Objective
Develop a REST API with full CRUD capabilities along with a simple To-Do List application. The challenge aims to evaluate proficiency in JavaScript and related technologies.

## Requirements

1. **REST API**:
   - Implement a RESTful API supporting CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
   - A database can be used but is not mandatory.

2. **To-Do List Application**:
   - Develop a To-Do List application that interacts with the REST API.
   - The application must allow users to add, view, edit, and delete tasks.

3. **Technologies**:
   - JavaScript (preference given to TypeScript for higher scoring).
   - Utilize Docker for containerization (this will be highly valued).
   - Style the application using Tailwind CSS (preferred over custom styles).

## Evaluation Criteria
- Functionality and completeness of the REST API.
- Usage of a database (either relational or non-relational is considered a plus).
- User interface of the To-Do List application, developed with React Native + Expo.
- Use of TypeScript for improved type safety and maintainability.
- Implementation of Docker for better deployment practices.
- Code quality, project structure, and overall organization.

## Submission Guidelines
- The project must be submitted via a GitHub repository.
- Include a README.md file with detailed instructions on how to set up and run the project.

## Deadline
- The project must be completed and submitted within **12 hours** of receipt and confirmation of receipt of this document.
